In traffic officers where it's stated that each traffic officer has a city where the
officer operates, it's given as a set attribute in the ER diagram. I would prefer that as
a separate entity having a participation constraint from traffic officers. I like how he
put each entity as an ISA relationship from the "super entity"  person. He put a
constraint and one to many relationship from mother to birth registration following the
statement: "A birth may be registered without a father but always has a mother." I believe
it would be a participation constraint from mothers registering for birth. I also believe
that there needs to be a one to many relationship from vehicle to vehicle registration as
"a vehicle can have multiple registrations. Other than these points, everything else seems
good to me.

Some details on how traffic officer as an entity has city as an attribute would be great for describing how each officer has a city where he operates. Vehicles can have multiple registrations are not present as a constraint in the relation between vehicles and registration. Since License class is a weak entity, it has to be bolded from the relation. However, since it is stated that a unique ID is present in every license class, putting that as a weak entity is not necessary. Other than that, everything else seems okay.

The arrow integrity constraint is missing from register_by to birth. I don't think you should have a relationship connecting Traffic Officer and city; there is also no need
for a participation constraint that says Traffic officer operates on exactly one city.
Please make sure the file is correctly oriented. Looks good otherwise.

Your diagram suggests that each vehicle is owned_by exactly one driver, but this is not
the case. Also, avoid crossing over lines over, as this may make the diagram disorganized.
I'm not sure each Ticket is given_to each vehicle; I expressed this as each Ticket is
given_to the vehicle's registration. Why is LicenseClass a weak entity? I think the city
attribute of Traffic_Officer should instead be a set-value attribute, since a
Traffic_Officer may operate in more than one city. Looks good otherwise.
