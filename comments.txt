In traffic officers where it's stated that each traffic officer has a city where the officer operates, it's given as a set attribute in the ER diagram. I would prefer that as a separate entity having a participation constraint from traffic officers. I like how he put each entity as an ISA relationship from the "super entity"  person. He put a constraint and one to many relationship from mother to birth registration following the statement: "A birth may be registered without a father but always has a mother." I believe it would be a participation constraint from mothers registering for birth. I also believe that there needs to be a one to many relationship from vehicle to vehicle registration as "a vehicle can have multiple registrations. Other than these points, everything else seems good to me.

Some details on how traffic officer as an entity has city as an attribute would be great for describing how each officer has a city where he operates. Vehicles can have multiple registrations are not present as a constraint in the relation between vehicles and registration. Since License class is a weak entity, it has to be bolded from the relation. However, since it is stated that a unique ID is present in every license class, putting that as a weak entity is not necessary. Other than that, everything else seems okay.
